## Important Security Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: This is a PUBLIC repository. Before proceeding:
- ✅ ONLY include information suitable for public documentation
- ❌ NEVER include private game mechanics, internal systems, or confidential information
- ❌ NEVER include API keys, credentials, or sensitive configuration
- ✅ Focus on player-facing features and public game information
- ✅ Review all changes to ensure they don't expose internal game details

## Steps to Create PR

1. **Review All Changes**:
   - Run `git status` and `git diff` to see uncommitted changes
   - Run `git log origin/main..HEAD` to see all commits in the current branch

2. **Analyze Changes**:
   - Summarize what documentation was added/updated
   - List all modified files
   - Verify no sensitive information is included
   - Check for any merge conflicts or formatting issues

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Push the current branch to remote with `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
