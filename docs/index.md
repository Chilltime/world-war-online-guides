# Beginner Guide

![Welcome to World War Online](images/header_welcome.webp "Beginner Guide")

We hope this Guide will help you grow quick in our game, until you become an experienced player, by
giving you an overview as a beginner of how to play the game, good ways to start, and where to go
from there.

## Short introduction

World War Online is a PvP MMO Strategy Game where you control and command your armies, work with
allies to create Squads and engage in conflicts and diplomacy with other players and squads.

The main objective is for Squads of players to conquer Capitals in
[Capital Warfare](guides/capital-warfare.md) and get points for the
[Leaderboard](guides/leaderboard-squad.md), where at the end of each Season - which lasts around 3
months - **the winners receive in-game rewards for the next Season and the glory of carrying their
country flag to the top of the podium!**

## Starting

When you [create an account](guides/player-intro.md) in World War Online, and login for the first
time in a Season, you will be presented with a short Tutorial Video. This Tutorial serves to show
you some of the basic mechanics of the game, and the User Interface (UI). Once it finishes you will
be dropped into the [World Map](guides/maps-movement.md) and told that your Mission Center is on the
top left corner.

## Mission Center

In the Mission Center, you will find different Missions in the form of a Tech Tree - where
completing missions will unlock Different Units, Base Upgrades,
[Campaign Levels](guides/campaign.md), Squads and, finally, the access to Capital Warfare battles!

These missions should help you grow to around Military Rank 20-25. Once you finish these (except for
Conquer Capital), you will set yourself up on your path to victory.

## Basics

### Units

![What units exist in World War Online](images/header_unit_types.webp "Unit Introduction")

World War Online has 4 basic [unit types](guides/unit-intro.md): Infantry, Armored, Air and Navy.
Inside each one, you will find 1 type of unit that has an advantage over another unit type. These
are then split into Normal and Supreme Units, where Supreme Units are empowered versions of Normal
Units. Given their strength, fewer of them are allowed on the battlefield (max. 25), where a player
must make a choice on whether they wish to use a Supreme Unit or a Normal unit, given that the
budget is fair and shared. You can know more about it in [Unit Stats](guides/unit-stats.md) section.

### Headquarters

![What is the HQ base?](images/beginner_headquarters.webp "Your Headquarters Base")

The only base you start with is the [Headquarters Base](guides/bases.md), where you can produce
[Iron](guides/resources.md) and train Units.

Upgrading your Headquarters Base will allow you to have a greater number of units (increases Upkeep)
and will increase your resource production. Since your Headquarters can never be destroyed, you
don’t need to be too worried about protecting it from threats, but your resources can be stolen! So
it is always good to have units defending your Headquarters so that you don’t wake up without
resources!

### Resources

You have 2 different types of [Resources](guides/resources.md), these being **Iron** and
**WWO-Influence**.

WWO-Influence is the in-game currency of World War Online, and can be used to:

-   Train Supreme Units.
-   Train Normal Units (when you run out of Iron).
-   Accelerate the Upgrade time of Headquarters Base and the training time of your Units.
-   Purchase Special Deals in the store.

Other than your hourly production, you can steal Iron from enemies, by raiding their Headquarters
bases. This will essentially allow you to double your maximum daily production, which in turn allows
you to produce more units, and upgrade your Headquarters base.

### Movement

![How to move units](images/beginner_moving_units.webp "Moving Units")

To travel around the world, players need to understand movement. There are 2 ways that players can
move around the map:

-   **Clicking on the Unit Flag** (blue rectangular baloon) will allow you to click on "Move" and
    drag the cursor to wherever you want on the map. Clicking on another continent will allow you to
    move those units to another continent.
-   **Clicking on any district** will have the “Move” button on the top right corner in the District
    Sidebar. This will show all units that are available to be moved in that continent. You can also
    select different continents from the top menu when moving to a district.

Movement takes time, but you do have the option to accelerate unit movements by using WWO-Influence.
The cost to accelerate unit movements is determined by each given distance.

## Playing the Game

Once you have explored the map, understood the mechanics of World War Online, either by yourself or
through the help of a Squad, you want to start focusing on what your end-goal is. Given that this is
an MMO, players are allowed to do what they want with their armies, whether they want to be Rogue
commanders, seeking to destroy units of those who are enemies of their friends, join a squad and
dominate in the Leaderboard, or simply play solo and Duel against other players and compete in the
Player Leaderboard.

**Thanks for reading and good luck conquering the world!**
