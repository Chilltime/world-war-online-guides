# Unit Movement

![Moving in the map](../assets/images/map_movement.webp "Map Movements")

To get around in the world, players need to understand movement. Moving your units strategically across the map is essential for both offensive operations and defensive positioning.

## How to Move Units

There are two ways to move your units around the map:

### Method 1: Unit Flag

1. Click on the **Unit Flag** in any district where you have units
2. Select **Move**
3. Drag the cursor to your destination
4. Clicking on another continent allows you to move units between continents

### Method 2: District Sidebar

1. Click on any district to open the District Sidebar
2. Click the **Move In** button in the top right corner
3. This shows all units available to move in that continent
4. Select different continents from the top menu to move units from other continents

## Movement Time and Acceleration

Movement takes time based on the distance traveled. However, you have the option to accelerate unit movements using [WWO-Influence](resources.md).

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Base Speed** | Determined by distance between origin and destination |
| **Acceleration Cost** | WWO-Influence cost varies based on distance |
| **Strategic Timing** | Plan movements ahead to avoid needing expensive acceleration |

## Strategic Movement Tips

### Offensive Operations

- **Pre-position units** near targets before launching attacks
- **Coordinate with squad members** to converge on objectives simultaneously
- **Use multiple continents** to flank enemies from unexpected directions

### Defensive Operations

- **Reinforce threatened bases** quickly by pre-staging units nearby
- **Create defensive networks** with units positioned to support each other
- **Monitor enemy movements** and reposition accordingly

### Resource Efficiency

- **Plan ahead** to avoid costly acceleration during critical operations
- **Save WWO-Influence** for emergency repositioning when time-critical
- **Use natural travel time** strategically - send units during off-peak hours
