World War Online has specific rules that govern when and how battles can occur. Understanding these rules is crucial for planning your attacks and defending your bases effectively.

## Common Rules

These rules apply to **all battles**, whether attacking regular bases or capitals:

### Cannot Attack Yourself or Squad Members
- ❌ You cannot attack your own bases
- ❌ You cannot attack bases owned by members of your squad

### Battle Availability
- ✅ Battles must be enabled for the current season
- Check the game announcements for battle availability schedules

### Unit Setup Validation
- ✅ Your attacking units must form a valid battlefield composition
- Units must be properly configured for the attack action

### Same Base Attack Limit
- ⚠️ You can only have **one active attack** to any specific base at a time
- Wait for your current attack to complete before launching another attack to the same base

### Player Attack Limit (Non-Capital Bases Only)
- ⚠️ You can attack the same player a **maximum number of times within 24 hours**
- This limit applies to **non-capital bases only**
- Capital bases do **not** have a 24-hour attack limit

### Conquering Bases
To conquer a base, you must include a **General** unit in your attack:
- General (Normal)
- General Boxer (Special variant)

**Conquest Restrictions:**
- You cannot conquer a base if you've reached your base limit for that type
- Base limits vary by type:
  - **Headquarters**: 1 (cannot be conquered)
  - **Military Bases**: 5 maximum
  - **Resource Bases**: 10 maximum
  - **Mine Bases**: 4 maximum

### Destroying Bases
To destroy a base, you must include **Special Forces** units in your attack.

**Destruction Restrictions:**
- ❌ You **cannot destroy Capital bases**
- ✅ All other base types can be destroyed if the attack is successful

## Capital Specific Rules

Attacking **capital bases** has additional strict requirements beyond the common rules:

### 1. Squad Membership Required
- ✅ You **must** be a member of a squad to attack capital bases
- ❌ Solo players cannot participate in capital warfare

### 2. Active Capital Warfare Required
- ✅ Your squad must have an **active Capital Warfare** session
- Capital warfare sessions have specific start and end times
- You can only attack capitals during your squad's active warfare window

### 3. Valid Capital Target
- ✅ You can **only** attack capitals that are part of your squad's assigned Capital Warfare targets
- Each Capital Warfare session assigns specific countries/capitals your squad can attack
- ❌ Attacking capitals outside your assigned targets is **not allowed**

### 4. Squad Join Time Restriction
- ✅ You must have joined your squad **before** the Capital Warfare started
- ❌ Players who join a squad after a Capital Warfare begins **cannot participate** in that warfare
- You will be eligible to participate in the **next** Capital Warfare session

**Example:** If Capital Warfare starts on January 1st at 12:00 PM and you join the squad on January 1st at 1:00 PM, you cannot participate in that warfare. You must wait for the next Capital Warfare session.

### 5. No 24-Hour Attack Limit
- Unlike regular bases, capital bases do **not** have a 24-hour attack limit
- You can attack the same capital multiple times during the warfare window

## Battle Preparation Tips

1. **Check Base Limits** - Before attempting to conquer, verify you haven't reached your base limits
2. **Review Attack History** - Keep track of how many times you've attacked the same player
3. **Plan Capital Attacks** - Join squads early and coordinate with your team for Capital Warfare
4. **Include Tactical Units** - Add Generals for conquest or Special Forces for destruction when needed
5. **Monitor Active Attacks** - Track your ongoing attacks to avoid duplicate attacks on the same base
