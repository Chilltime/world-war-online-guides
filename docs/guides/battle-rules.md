# Battle Rules

![Battles in World War Online](../assets/images/header_unit_types.webp "Battle Rules")

World War Online has specific rules that govern when and how battles can occur. Understanding these rules is crucial for planning your attacks and defending your bases effectively.

## Types of Attacks

World War Online offers three distinct attack types, each serving different strategic objectives:

### Normal Attack (Raid)

Normal attacks focus on resource acquisition. When you win a battle, your surviving units can steal resources from the enemy base:

- **Headquarters**: Provides various resource types based on the headquarters level
- **Resource Bases**: Provides the specific resource that base produces (Food, Iron, Money, or Brick)
- **Mine Bases**: Allows you to steal accumulated resources

**Resource Carrying Capacity**: The amount of resources you can steal depends on your surviving units. Each unit can carry resources equal to **5% of its total health** - sending more units (especially heavier ones) increases your stealing potential. See [Resource Stealing](resources.md#resource-stealing-and-carrying-capacity) for detailed mechanics.

### Conquer Attack

Conquer attacks allow you to take ownership of enemy bases using the **General** tactical unit:

- **How it works**: Include a General in your attack. If the General survives and you achieve a Decisive Victory, the base becomes yours
- **General is consumed**: After successfully conquering a base, the General unit is removed from your army - plan your conquests strategically
- **Level preserved**: When you conquer a base, its level is maintained - conquering a Level 10 resource base gives you Level 10 production immediately
- **Resource Bases**: Become part of your territory and their production counts toward your economy
- **Capital Bases**: Award points for your [Squad Leaderboard](leaderboard-squad.md) and [Country Leaderboard](leaderboard-player.md) - a central objective in World War Online

**Restrictions:**
- ❌ You **cannot conquer Headquarters** - only resource bases, military bases, mines, and capitals
- ❌ You cannot conquer a base if you've reached your [base limit](bases.md) for that type

For detailed information about Generals, see [Tactical Units - General](units-tactic.md#general).

### Destroy Attack

Destroy attacks permanently remove enemy bases from the game using **Special Forces** tactical units:

- **How it works**: Include Special Forces in your attack. If at least one Special Forces unit survives and you achieve a Decisive Victory, the base is destroyed
- **Special Forces is consumed**: After successfully destroying a base, the Special Forces unit is removed from your army
- **Permanent destruction**: The base is completely removed and cannot be rebuilt by any player in that location

**Valid Targets:**
- ✅ Resource Bases (Food, Iron, Money, Brick)
- ✅ Mine Bases
- ❌ **Cannot destroy Capital Bases**
- ❌ **Cannot destroy Headquarters**

**Strategic Uses:**
- Deny resources to enemy players
- Remove strategic military positions
- Counter territorial expansion by eliminating newly built bases

For detailed information about Special Forces, see [Tactical Units - Special Forces](units-tactic.md#special-forces).

## Common Rules

These rules apply to **all battles**, whether attacking regular bases or capitals:

### Cannot Attack Yourself or Squad Members
- ❌ You cannot attack your own bases
- ❌ You cannot attack bases owned by members of your squad

### Battle Availability
- ✅ Battles must be enabled for the current season
- Check the game announcements for battle availability schedules

### Same Base Attack Limit
- ⚠️ You can only have **one active attack** to any specific base at a time
- Wait for your current attack to complete before launching another attack to the same base

### Player Attack Limit (Non-Capital Bases Only)
- ⚠️ You can attack the same player a **maximum number of times within 24 hours**
- This limit applies to **non-capital bases only**
- Capital bases do **not** have a 24-hour attack limit

### Conquering Bases
To conquer a base, you must include a **General** unit in your attack:
- General (Normal)
- General Boxer (Special variant)

**Conquest Restrictions:**
- You cannot conquer a base if you've reached your base limit for that type
- Base limits vary by type:
  - **Headquarters**: 1 (cannot be conquered)
  - **Military Bases**: 5 maximum
  - **Resource Bases**: 10 maximum
  - **Mine Bases**: 4 maximum

### Destroying Bases
To destroy a base, you must include **Special Forces** units in your attack.

**Destruction Restrictions:**
- ❌ You **cannot destroy Capital bases**
- ✅ All other base types can be destroyed if the attack is successful

## Capital Specific Rules

Attacking **capital bases** has additional strict requirements beyond the common rules:

### 1. Squad Membership Required
- ✅ You **must** be a member of a squad to attack capital bases
- ❌ Solo players cannot participate in capital warfare

### 2. Active Capital Warfare Required
- ✅ Your squad must have an **active Capital Warfare** session
- Capital warfare sessions have specific start and end times
- You can only attack capitals during your squad's active warfare window

### 3. Valid Capital Target
- ✅ You can **only** attack capitals that are part of your squad's assigned Capital Warfare targets
- Each Capital Warfare session assigns specific countries/capitals your squad can attack
- ❌ Attacking capitals outside your assigned targets is **not allowed**

### 4. Squad Join Time Restriction
- ✅ You must have joined your squad **before** the Capital Warfare started
- ❌ Players who join a squad after a Capital Warfare begins **cannot participate** in that warfare
- You will be eligible to participate in the **next** Capital Warfare session

**Example:** If Capital Warfare starts on January 1st at 12:00 PM and you join the squad on January 1st at 1:00 PM, you cannot participate in that warfare. You must wait for the next Capital Warfare session.

### 5. No 24-Hour Attack Limit
- Unlike regular bases, capital bases do **not** have a 24-hour attack limit
- You can attack the same capital multiple times during the warfare window

## Battle Preparation Tips

1. **Check Base Limits** - Before attempting to conquer, verify you haven't reached your base limits
2. **Review Attack History** - Keep track of how many times you've attacked the same player
3. **Plan Capital Attacks** - Join squads early and coordinate with your team for Capital Warfare
4. **Include Tactical Units** - Add Generals for conquest or Special Forces for destruction when needed
5. **Monitor Active Attacks** - Track your ongoing attacks to avoid duplicate attacks on the same base
