# Battles Overview

![Battles in World War Online](../assets/images/header_unit_types.webp "Battle Rules")

World War Online features three distinct attack types, each serving different strategic objectives. Understanding when and how to use each type is crucial for success.

## Types of Attacks

| Attack Type | Objective | Required Unit | Result on Victory |
|:------------|:----------|:--------------|:------------------|
| **[Attacking](battle-attack-intro.md)** | Steal resources | None (normal units) | Resources stolen |
| **[Conquering](battle-conquer-intro.md)** | Take ownership of base | General | Base becomes yours |
| **[Destroying](battle-destroy-intro.md)** | Remove base permanently | Special Forces | Base is destroyed |

## Choosing Your Attack Type

### When to Attack (Raid)

Use normal attacks when you want to:

- **Steal resources** from enemy bases
- **Weaken enemy economy** through repeated raids
- **Test defenses** before committing tactical units
- **Farm resources** efficiently

### When to Conquer

Use conquer attacks when you want to:

- **Expand your territory** by taking enemy bases
- **Capture Capital Bases** for squad points
- **Acquire high-level bases** that would take time to build
- **Deny strategic positions** to enemies

### When to Destroy

Use destroy attacks when you want to:

- **Permanently remove** enemy infrastructure
- **Deny resources** to enemy players long-term
- **Counter territorial expansion** by eliminating new bases
- **Strategic denial** in contested areas

## Battle Mechanics

All battles share common mechanics:

| Mechanic | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| **11 Waves** | Battles consist of 11 combat waves |
| **Generals appear Wave 11** | Tactical units enter on the final wave |
| **Decisive Victory required** | Conquest and destruction need clear wins |
| **Unit capacity** | 10,000 units per non-capital base |

## Common Rules

These rules apply to all battle types:

- You cannot attack your own bases or squad members' bases
- Only one active attack per specific base at a time
- Attack limits apply to non-capital bases (3 per player per district per 12 hours)
- Capital bases have no attack limit during warfare

## Battalion Support

Battalion members can reinforce each other's attacks and defenses:

| Support Type | Requirement | Effect |
|:-------------|:------------|:-------|
| **Attack Support** | Within 4 districts of target | Join ally's attack at wave 10 |
| **Defense Support** | Within 4 districts of ally's base | Reinforce defense at wave 10 |

Support units are limited to 30% of the district's capacity. See [Battalion Support](battle-battalion-support-intro.md) for details.
