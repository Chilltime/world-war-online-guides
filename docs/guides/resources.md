Resources are the currencies used to train [Units](unit-intro.md), upgrade your
[Headquarters Base](bases.md), and maintain your military infrastructure.

World War Online has five different resources:
- **WWO-Influence** (Premium Currency)
- **Money**
- **Iron**
- **Food**
- **Brick**

## WWO-Influence (Premium)

![World War Online Resources](../assets/images/resources_wwo.webp "Game Resources")

WWO-Influence is the premium resource in World War Online, primarily gained through in-game purchases in the [Store](store.md).

Players who end a Season in Gold and Silver Leagues for [Squad Leaderboard](leaderboard-squad.md)
also receive WWO-Influence that transfers to the next Season of World War Online.

WWO-Influence can be used to:

- Train Supreme Units and Special Forces units
- Train Normal Units (if a player is out of their primary resource)
- Accelerate units movement on the map
- Accelerate units training
- Accelerate Headquarters Base upgrades
- Purchase Special Deals in Store
- Construct new bases (Resource, Military, and Mine bases)

WWO-Influence can also be collected daily, for free, through Supply Crates, but once you get **500
WWO or more** in your account, you stop receiving the bonuses until getting below this value again.

Also, you can only collect up to **15.000 WWO-Influence per week**.

## Resource Usage by Unit Type

Each unit type in World War Online requires a specific resource for training:

| Unit Category | Resource Used | Examples |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Infantry | Food | Soldier, Bazooka, Stinger, LG1 |
| Armored | Iron | BMD-3 Bakhcha, M3A3 Bradley, Gepard, Dongfeng |
| Air | Money | UH-60 Black Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, Chengdu J7, Lynx |
| Sea | Iron | Christy, Pomornik, Arleigh Burke, Akula II |
| Supreme Units | Premium | All supreme versions of regular units |
| Special Forces | Premium | Special Forces unit |
| General | Premium | General unit |

## Money

Money is a resource primarily used for training Air units. It's generated from dedicated Money Resource Bases.

Money is used for:
- Training all Air category units (Black Hawk, Reaper, Chengdu, Lynx)
- Supporting base construction and maintenance
- Trading with other players

Money Resource Bases can be constructed to increase your production rate. As your Money Resource Bases level up, they will produce more Money per hour.

## Iron

Iron is a resource that is generated in your **Headquarters** and specialized Iron Resource Bases. The amount of Iron you currently have available is displayed at the top of the screen. A player can only have a maximum of 500,000 Iron in their resource pool at any given time.

Iron is primarily used for:
- Training Armored units (Bakhcha, Bradley, Gepard, Dongfeng)
- Training Sea units (Christy, Pomornik, Arleigh Burke, Akula)
- Upgrading your Headquarters Base
- Maintaining your Army's upkeep

The higher the level of your Headquarters Base, the higher the amount of Iron you generate.

### Army Upkeep

![Army Upkeep](../assets/images/resources_upkeep.webp "Army Upkeep Resources")

**Army Upkeep** is a small amount of Resources that is subtracted from your Resource Production every 10 minutes based on how many Units you have.

If your Resource Production is equal to your Army Upkeep, you will no longer be able to produce any more units until your resource production is positive.

## Food

Food is an essential resource needed to sustain your military forces. It's produced by specialized Food Resource Bases.

Food is primarily used for:
- Training all Infantry category units (Soldier, Bazooka, Stinger, LG1)
- Sustaining your army's upkeep
- Supporting base operations in challenging environments

Food Resource Bases can be constructed using WWO-Influence and upgraded to increase their production rate. Strategic placement of Food Resource Bases near your military operations can minimize transportation costs and ensure a steady supply.

## Brick

Brick is a construction material resource used for fortification and building projects. It's produced by dedicated Brick Resource Bases.

Brick is primarily used for:
- Upgrading bases and facilities
- Constructing defensive fortifications
- Reinforcing existing structures
- Building specialized military installations

Brick Resource Bases can be constructed to ensure a steady supply of this construction material. As with other resource bases, the production rate increases as you upgrade the base level.

## Resource Management Tips

Effective resource management is crucial for success in World War Online:

1. **Understand unit resource requirements** - Different unit types require different resources, so plan your resource production based on your army composition strategy.

2. **Diversify your resource production** - Build a mix of different resource bases to ensure you have all necessary materials.

3. **Balance your economy** - Make sure your resource production exceeds your army's upkeep.

4. **Prioritize critical resources** - Focus on resources that align with your strategy (e.g., Food for infantry-focused armies, Iron for armored/sea units, Money for air units).

5. **Protect your resource bases** - Station units to defend valuable resource production facilities.

6. **Upgrade strategically** - Invest in upgrading bases that produce resources you use most frequently.

7. **Maintain reserves** - Keep a buffer of resources to respond to unexpected opportunities or threats.

8. **Use Brick efficiently** - Since Brick is primarily used for base upgrades, focus on collecting it when planning infrastructure improvements.
