# Capital Bases

Capital Bases are special bases that are automatically generated inside world capitals during [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md) events. These bases are fundamental to winning the game, as conquering and holding them earns points for both the [Battalion Leaderboard](leaderboard-battalion.md) and [Player Leaderboard](leaderboard-player.md).

## Key Features
