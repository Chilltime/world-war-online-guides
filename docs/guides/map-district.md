# District View

![Map Districts](../assets/images/map_district.webp "Map Districts")

The District View is your tactical command center, showing detailed information about bases, armies, and recent battles within a specific district.

## District Sidebar

When you open a district, a sidebar appears with all essential information:

### Action Buttons

| Button | Function |
|:-------|:---------|
| **Manage Defense** | Configure your defensive setup (if you have units in the district) |
| **Train Units** | Access unit training options |
| **Move In** | Select units from anywhere to move to this district |

### Information Displayed

- **Your Defense Setup** - Current defensive configuration
- **Your Army** - Units you have stationed here
- **Enemy Units** - Visible enemy positions (targetable)
- **Other Armies** - Squad members and guerilla forces
- **Base Information** - Hover tooltips showing base types
- **Recent Battles** - Last 5 battles in the past 2 hours

## District Types

### Guerrilla Districts

The majority of the world map consists of Guerrilla districts:

- Produce and deploy Air and Land units
- Standard combat rules apply
- Can contain all base types

### Coastal Districts

Guerrilla districts located next to water:

- All Guerrilla features plus Navy unit production
- Strategic for naval-focused players
- Often key defensive positions

### Capital Districts

Special districts accessible only during Capital Warfare:

- Fixed number of Capital Bases
- Requires squad membership to attack
- Primary objective for competitive play

## Scouting Enemy Positions

Enemy units positioned in districts are now visible, allowing you to:

- **Plan strategic attacks** - Identify weaknesses in enemy defenses
- **Choose appropriate forces** - Match your composition to counter theirs
- **Target high-value bases** - Use tooltips to identify resource-rich targets

## Attack Rate Limiting

District attacks use a strategic timing system:

| Rule | Details |
|:-----|:--------|
| **Attack Limit** | 3 attacks per player per district per 12 hours |
| **District-Specific** | Limits are per district, not global |
| **Countdown Timer** | Shows when you can attack again |

This prevents overwhelming individual players while allowing multi-front conflicts.

## Live Battle Monitoring

Keep the District Sidebar open to watch battles unfold in real-time. This helps you:

- Track squad operations
- Monitor enemy activity
- Time your own attacks strategically
