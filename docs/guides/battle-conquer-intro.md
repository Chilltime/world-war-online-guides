# Conquering Bases

Conquer attacks allow you to take ownership of enemy bases using the **General** tactical unit. This is how you expand your territory and capture strategic positions including Capital Bases.

## How Conquering Works

To conquer a base:

1. **Include a General** in your attack force
2. **Achieve a Decisive Victory** in the battle
3. **General must survive** the 11 waves of combat
4. The base becomes yours upon victory

**Important:** The General is consumed after successfully conquering a base - plan your conquests strategically.

## What You Can Conquer

| Base Type | Can Conquer? | Notes |
|:----------|:------------:|:------|
| Resource Bases | Yes | Level is preserved |
| Mine Bases | Yes | Level is preserved |
| Military Bases | Yes | Level is preserved |
| Capital Bases | Yes | Awards battalion and player points |
| Headquarters | **No** | Cannot be conquered |

## Level Preservation

When you conquer a base, **its level is maintained**:

- Conquering a Level 10 resource base gives you Level 10 production immediately
- This makes high-level enemy bases valuable conquest targets
- You save the Brick and time that would be needed to upgrade from scratch

## Base Limits

You cannot conquer a base if you've reached your limit for that type:

| Base Type | Maximum Limit |
|:----------|:-------------:|
| Headquarters | 1 (cannot conquer) |
| Resource Bases | 10 |
| Mine Bases | 4 |
| Military Bases | 5 |
| Capital Bases | No player limit |

## General Types

Two General variants can conquer bases:

| General | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **General** | Standard conquest unit |
| **General Boxer** | Special variant with unique abilities |

Both are consumed upon successful conquest.
