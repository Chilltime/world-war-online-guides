# Food

Food is an essential resource needed to train your [Infantry units](units-normal.md). It's produced by specialized Food Resource Bases.

## Uses for Food

Food is primarily used for:

- Training all Infantry category units:
  - **Soldier** - Basic infantry unit
  - **Bazooka** - Anti-armor infantry
  - **Stinger** - Anti-air infantry
  - **LG1** - Artillery infantry
- Supporting base operations

## Production

Food is produced by **Food Resource Bases**. Build these bases to increase your Food production rate.

| Base Level | Production Rate |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
| Level 1 | 640/hour |
| Level 5 | 800/hour |
| Level 10 | 1,000/hour |

Food Resource Bases can be constructed using WWO-Influence and upgraded to increase their production rate.

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Prioritize Food Production

- **Infantry-focused strategy** - If you rely heavily on Infantry units
- **Early game expansion** - Infantry units are often cost-effective for new players
- **Balanced armies** - Infantry provide important anti-armor and anti-air capabilities

### Building Food Bases

- You can build up to **10 Resource Bases** total (shared across all resource types)
- Construction costs range from 4-8 WWO-Influence depending on how many resource bases you own
- Strategic placement of Food Resource Bases helps ensure efficient military operations
