# Bases in World War Online

![What is the HQ base?](../assets/images/beginner_headquarters.webp "Your Headquarters Base")

World War Online features several types of bases, each with its own purpose and strategic importance:

-   **Headquarters Base** - Your primary base that provides Iron production and unit training
-   **Capital Bases** - Strategic conquest points in Capital Warfare that determine winners
-   **Military Bases** - Specialized bases for training Special Forces units
-   **Resource Bases** - Generate various resources (Money, Food, Brick, Iron)
-   **Mine Bases** - Specialized in high-volume Iron production

## Headquarters Base

Upon creating an account in World War Online, you will receive a **Headquarters Base** placed randomly in the territory of your Country, which cannot be relocated.

The Headquarters Base is your primary base that provides steady Iron production and serves as your main training facility where you can train [Supreme Units](units-supreme.md) and [Generals](units-tactic.md). Upgrading your Headquarters increases your Iron production and provides additional strategic advantages. Although your Headquarters can be raided for resources, it cannot be conquered or destroyed.

### Headquarters Defense Bonus

Districts containing your Headquarters provide enhanced defensive capabilities:

- **8 unit groups** can be positioned for defense (instead of the standard 6)
- **4,000 normal units** can be deployed (instead of the standard 3,000)
- This strategic advantage helps protect your command center and surrounding territory
- The headquarters defense bonus is indicated with a special badge in the district view

## Resource Bases

Resource Bases produce each type of [resource](resources.md) in the game: Money, Iron, Food, and Brick. You can build up to **10 Resource bases per player**, allowing you to specialize in the resources that support your strategic goals.

### Base Construction Costs

Building Resource Bases requires [WWO-Influence](resources.md), with costs increasing based on how many resource bases you already own:

| Number of Resource Bases | Construction Cost (WWO) |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 1                        | 4                       |

## Mine Bases

Mine Bases produce significantly more Iron than Resource bases but are limited to **4 per player**. They have the highest Iron production rate among all base types, making them valuable for players who rely heavily on Armored and Sea units.

### Base Construction Costs

Building Mine Bases requires [WWO-Influence](resources.md), with costs increasing for each additional mine:

| Number of Mine Bases | Construction Cost (WWO) |
|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|

Military Bases are specialized bases that allow you to train [Special Forces units](units-tactic.md). You can build up to **5 Military bases per player**. These bases serve as forward operating positions and training facilities for your elite tactical units.

### Base Construction Costs

Building Military Bases requires [WWO-Influence](resources.md) at a fixed cost:
- **Construction Cost**: 2 WWO-Influence per base

## Capital Bases

Capital Bases are special bases that are automatically generated inside world capitals during [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md) events. These bases are fundamental to winning the game, as conquering and holding them earns points for both the [Squad Leaderboard](leaderboard-squad.md) and [Player Leaderboard](leaderboard-player.md).

**Key Features:**
- **Automatically created** when a Capital Warfare event starts
- **Cannot be constructed** by players - only conquered
- **Cannot be upgraded** or modified
- **Cannot be destroyed** - only conquered and defended
- **Earn competitive points** for your squad and personal ranking when held
- **Strategic importance**: Controlling capital bases is how squads win seasons and earn rewards

Capital Bases represent the ultimate strategic objectives in World War Online. Coordinating with your squad to conquer and defend these bases during Capital Warfare events is essential for achieving victory and climbing the leaderboards.

## Automatic Base Defense

Your bases feature automatic defense setup to ensure they're never left completely undefended:

-   **Auto-Defense System**: When you haven't created a defense setup yet or have insufficient units positioned, the system automatically sets up defenses using your strongest available units
-   **Smart Prioritization**: The system prioritizes your largest unit groups first and maximizes unit type diversity to create a balanced defense
-   **Strategic Positioning**: Units are placed strategically to maximize defensive effectiveness
-   **Fully Customizable**: You can still edit and customize these automatic defenses at any time to match your preferred strategy
-   **Complete Control**: You maintain full control over your defensive strategy while having a solid baseline defense automatically created
-   **Peace of Mind**: Never worry about leaving a base undefended - the system has you covered

This feature is particularly useful when managing multiple bases, when you need to quickly set up defenses across your territory, or when enemy units in districts become visible and targetable.
