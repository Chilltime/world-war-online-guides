# Bases in World War Online

![What is the HQ base?](../assets/images/beginner_headquarters.webp "Your Headquarters Base")

World War Online features several types of bases, each with its own purpose and strategic importance:

-   **Headquarters Base** - Your primary base that provides Iron production
-   **Capital Bases** - Strategic conquest points (see more in [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md))
-   **Military Bases** - Enhance unit training capabilities
-   **Resource Bases** - Generate various resources (Money, Food, Brick)
-   **Mine Bases** - Specialized in Iron production

## Headquarters Base

Upon creating an account in World War Online, you will receive a **Headquarters Base** placed
randomly in the territory of your Country, which cannot be relocated.

The Headquarters Base is your primary base that provides a steady Iron production and also acts as a
Military Base, producing units. **Upgrading your Headquarters allows you to increase your Resource
Production and Increase your Daily Steal Capacity**. Although your Headquarters can be raided, it
cannot be Conquered or Destroyed.

### How to Upgrade your Headquarters Base

Your Headquarters Base can be upgraded to increase its' benefits, namely to increase the production
of [Iron](resources.md).

You can upgrade your Headquarters using Iron, and everytime it levels up you will get some XP
besides increasing the Iron Production. If you want to **accelerate the upgrade process**, you can
use [WWO-Influence](resources.md), the in-game currency of World War Online.

The production rate depends on the level of the Headquarters Base, where a higher level base
produces more resources. Your production rate also dictates the amount of units that you can have in
your army, as units have [Upkeep](unit-stats.md).

### Level 1-10

## Capital Bases

![Capital Bases](../assets/images/capital_bases.webp "Capital Bases")

Capital Bases are strategic conquest points that are essential for [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md). These bases serve as the backbone for territorial control and are instrumental in securing dominance in the game.

Key features of Capital Bases:
- Limited to 5 per player
- Can be conquered by enemy players using General units
- Provide production benefits at a rate of 50% compared to similar level Headquarters Base
- Cannot be constructed; they must be conquered from other players or NPCs
- Located only in specific coordinates in each district (central areas)
- Cost 0 WWO-Influence to acquire (through conquest)

Capital Bases provide modest resource production while offering strategic territorial control. As your capital base level increases, its production also increases according to the following progression:

| Base Level | Production Rate |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
|     1      |       100       |
|     2      |       125       |
|     3      |       150       |
|     4      |       200       |
|     5      |       250       |
|     6      |       375       |
|     7      |       500       |
|     8      |       750       |
|     9      |      1000       |
|     10     |      1250       |

|     9      |      2000       |
|     10     |      2500       |

Strategically placing Military Bases near your frontlines can provide significant advantages during conflicts.

## Resource Bases

Resource Bases generate various resources needed for your war effort. They can be specialized in one of the following resources:
- **Money** - Used for purchasing and upgrading various assets
- **Food** - Required for sustaining units
- **Brick** - Used for construction and fortification

Key features of Resource Bases:
- Limited to 10 per player
- Cost 4 WWO-Influence to construct
- Grant 500 experience points when constructed
- Can be specialized to focus on a specific resource type
- Production improves with each level upgrade

Resource Bases' production rates increase with each level:

| Base Level | Production Rate |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
|     1      |        60       |
|     2      |        80       |

|     9      |       220       |
|     10     |       240       |

Balancing your resource production based on your current strategic needs is essential for efficient progress.

## Mine Bases

Mine Bases are specialized in Iron production, which is the primary resource used for unit training and base upgrades. These bases provide the highest Iron production rates in the game.

Key features of Mine Bases:
- Limited to 4 per player
- Cost 8 WWO-Influence to construct
- Grant 500 experience points when constructed
- Provide double the Iron production compared to standard Resource Bases
- Can be targeted by enemies seeking to disrupt your resource production

Mine Bases' production rates increase with each level:

| Base Level | Production Rate |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
|     1      |       120       |
|     2      |       160       |
|     3      |       200       |

|     10     |       480       |

Protecting your Mine Bases should be a priority, as they provide essential resources for your war effort.

## Base Limits and Costs

Each type of base has a limit to how many you can own and a cost to construct:

| Base Type | Maximum Allowed | Cost (WWO-Influence) |
| :-------: | :-------------: | :------------------: |
| Headquarters |        1        |          20         |
| Capital     |        5        |           0         |
| Military    |        5        |           2         |
| Resource    |       10        |           4         |
| Mine        |        4        |           8         |

Strategically diversifying your base portfolio is essential for balanced gameplay. As you progress in military rank, consider expanding your network of bases to maximize resource production and military capabilities.

## Base Protection and Conquest

All bases except for your Headquarters can be conquered or destroyed:
- Capital Bases can be conquered using General units (see [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md))
- Any base can be destroyed using Special Forces units (see [Tactical Units](unit-intro.md))

To protect your bases, consider:
- Stationing defensive units at vulnerable bases
- Creating a network of bases that can support each other
- Upgrading bases to increase their defensive capabilities
- Joining a squad for mutual protection and support
