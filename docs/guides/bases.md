# Bases in World War Online

![What is the HQ base?](../assets/images/beginner_headquarters.webp "Your Headquarters Base")

World War Online features several types of bases, each with its own purpose and strategic importance:

-   **Headquarters Base** - Your primary base that provides Iron production
-   **Capital Bases** - Strategic conquest points (see more in [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md))
-   **Military Bases** - Enhance unit training capabilities
-   **Resource Bases** - Generate various resources (Money, Food, Brick)
-   **Mine Bases** - Specialized in Iron production

## Base Construction Costs

Building bases requires [WWO-Influence](resources.md), with the cost varying by type:

- **Military Base**: 2 WWO-Influence (fixed cost)
- **Resource Base**: 4 WWO-Influence (base cost)
- **Mine Base**: 8 WWO-Influence (base cost)

**Important**: The cost of Resource and Mine bases increases based on how many resource bases you already have. For every 2 resource/mine bases you own, the cost increases by 1 WWO-Influence:

| Number of Resource/Mine Bases | Resource Base Cost | Mine Base Cost |
|:----------------------------:|:------------------:|:--------------:|
| 1                            | 4                  | 8              |
| 2                            | 4                  | 10             |
| 3                            | 5                  | 12             |
| 4                            | 5                  | 14             |
| 5                            | 6                  | -              |
| 6                            | 6                  | -              |
| 7                            | 7                  | -              |
| 8                            | 7                  | -              |
| 9                            | 8                  | -              |
| 10                           | 8                  | -              |

**Cost Calculation:**
- Resource Bases: +1 WWO cost for every 2 resource bases
- Mine Bases: +2 WWO cost for each additional mine base

Note: You are limited to a maximum of 10 Resource bases and 4 Mine bases per player.

## Headquarters Base

Upon creating an account in World War Online, you will receive a **Headquarters Base** placed
randomly in the territory of your Country, which cannot be relocated.

The Headquarters Base is your primary base that provides a steady Iron production and also acts as a
Military Base, producing units. **Upgrading your Headquarters allows you to increase your Resource
Production and Increase your Daily Steal Capacity**. Although your Headquarters can be raided, it
cannot be Conquered or Destroyed.

### How to Upgrade your Headquarters Base

Your Headquarters Base can be upgraded to increase its' benefits, namely to increase the production
of [Iron](resources.md).

You can upgrade your Headquarters using Iron, and everytime it levels up you will get some XP
besides increasing the Iron Production. If you want to **accelerate the upgrade process**, you can
use [WWO-Influence](resources.md), the in-game currency of World War Online.

The production rate depends on the level of the Headquarters Base, where a higher level base
produces more resources. Your production rate also dictates the amount of units that you can have in
your army, as units have [Upkeep](unit-stats.md).

**Note:** Experience (XP) values shown are approximate and increase exponentially with each level.

Strategically diversifying your base portfolio is essential for balanced gameplay. As you progress in military rank, consider expanding your network of bases to maximize resource production and military capabilities.

## Base Upgrades and Resource Requirements

All bases except Capital Bases can be upgraded using Brick resources. The upgrade costs increase with each level and provide increased production rates.

Upgrading bases requires:
- Sufficient Brick resources 
- Meeting the military rank requirement for the upgrade
- Waiting for the upgrade timer to complete (can be accelerated with WWO-Influence)

As you upgrade your bases, you'll receive experience points and increased resource production rates, enhancing your overall military capabilities.

## Base Placement Rules

When placing bases on the map, you must follow certain rules:
- Bases must be placed at valid coordinates within districts
- Different base types have different placement restrictions
- Capital Bases have special placement coordinates in central district areas
- Your base network should be strategically planned to maximize territorial control and resource efficiency

## Base Protection and Conquest

All bases except for your Headquarters can be conquered or destroyed:
- Capital Bases can be conquered using General units (see [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md))
- Resource, Mine, and Military bases can be destroyed using Special Forces units (see [Tactical Units](unit-intro.md))

To protect your bases, consider:
- Stationing defensive units at vulnerable bases
- Creating a network of bases that can support each other
- Upgrading bases to increase their defensive capabilities
- Joining a squad for mutual protection and support
