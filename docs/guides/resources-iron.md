# Iron

Iron is a versatile resource generated in your **Headquarters** and specialized [Iron Resource Bases](bases-resource.md) and [Mine Bases](bases-mines.md). The amount of Iron you currently have is displayed at the top of the screen.

## Uses for Iron

Iron is primarily used for:

- Training [Armored units](units-normal.md):
  - **BMD-3 Bakhcha** - Light armored vehicle
  - **M3A3 Bradley** - Infantry fighting vehicle
  - **Gepard** - Anti-aircraft tank
  - **Dongfeng** - Heavy missile launcher
- Training [Sea units](units-normal.md):
  - **Christy** - Fast patrol boat
  - **Pomornik** - Landing craft
  - **Arleigh Burke** - Destroyer
  - **Akula II** - Attack submarine
- Upgrading your Headquarters Base

## Production Sources

Iron can be produced from multiple sources:

| Source | Max Bases | Level 10 Production |
|:-------|:---------:|:-------------------:|
| **Headquarters** | 1 | 3,000/hour |
| **Iron Resource Base** | Up to 10 (shared) | 1,000/hour |
| **Mine Base** | 4 | 2,000/hour |

The higher the level of your Headquarters Base, the higher the amount of Iron you generate. Mine Bases produce the highest Iron rate of any base type.

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Prioritize Iron Production

- **Armored-focused strategy** - Tanks and fighting vehicles require substantial Iron
- **Naval strategy** - Sea units also consume Iron
- **Headquarters upgrades** - Essential for progressing your main base

### Building Iron Production

- **Headquarters** - Always produces Iron, upgrade to increase output
- **Mine Bases** - Build up to 4 for maximum Iron production (8-14 WWO each)
- **Iron Resource Bases** - Lower output but share the 10-base limit with other resources

### Iron vs Mine Bases

| Feature | Iron Resource Base | Mine Base |
|:--------|:------------------:|:---------:|
| **Max Level 10 Output** | 1,000/hour | 2,000/hour |
| **Maximum Bases** | Shared (10 total) | 4 dedicated |
| **Construction Cost** | 4-8 WWO | 8-14 WWO |

Mine Bases cost more but produce double the Iron - essential for Armored/Sea focused players.
