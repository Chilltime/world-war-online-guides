# Attack Rules

This guide covers the specific rules and restrictions for normal attacks (raids) in World War Online.

## Basic Requirements

To launch a normal attack, you must meet these conditions:

| Requirement | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Valid target** | Cannot attack your own bases or battalion members |
| **Battles enabled** | Must be during an active battle period |
| **Valid unit setup** | Units must form a valid battlefield composition |
| **No active attack** | Cannot have another attack in progress to the same base |

## Attack Limitations

### Per-District Limit

- **3 attacks per 12 hours** to each player in a specific district
- Limits are per district - you can attack the same player in different districts
- A countdown timer shows when you can attack again

### Active Attack Limit

- Only **one active attack** to any specific base at a time
- Wait for your current attack to complete before launching another

### Capital Bases Exception

- Capital bases do **not** have attack limits during Capital Warfare
- You can attack capitals repeatedly during the warfare window

## What You Can Attack

| Base Type | Can Attack? | Notes |
|:----------|:----------:|:------|
| Headquarters | Yes | Cannot conquer or destroy, only raid |
| Resource Bases | Yes | All resource types |
| Mine Bases | Yes | High Iron targets |
| Military Bases | Yes | Strategic targets |
| Capital Bases | Conditional | Requires battalion membership and active warfare |

## What You Cannot Attack

- Your own bases
- Bases owned by your battalion members
- Capital bases without an active Capital Warfare session

## Battle Outcomes

| Outcome | Result |
|:--------|:-------|
| **Decisive Victory** | Resources stolen, units return |
| **Tie Breaker Victory** | Partial resources stolen |
| **Defeat** | No resources, surviving units return |

## Strategic Considerations

### Before Attacking

1. **Scout the target** - Check enemy defenses in the district
2. **Assess value** - Is the resource gain worth the unit risk?
3. **Check attack limit** - Do you have attacks remaining for this player?

### During Attack

- Battles consist of 11 waves
- Monitor battle progress if watching live
- Your units fight automatically based on composition

### After Attack

- Surviving units return with stolen resources
- Wait for cooldown before attacking same target again
- Review battle report to improve future attacks
