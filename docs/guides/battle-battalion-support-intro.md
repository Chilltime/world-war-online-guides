# Battalion Support

Battalion Support allows you to reinforce your battalion members' attacks and defenses by adding your units to their battles. Coordinate with allies to overwhelm enemies with combined forces.

## How Battalion Support Works

When a battalion member launches an attack or defends a base, you can send your units to support them:

- Join allies' attacks or defenses as reinforcements
- Support units use the **Support strategy only** (no attack or defense strategy selection)
- Your units arrive at **wave 10**, catching enemies off guard
- Coordinate with battalion members for powerful combined assaults

## Types of Support

### Attack Support

Reinforce a battalion member's attack on an enemy base:

- You must own bases within **4 districts** of the attack target
- Your support units join the attack at wave 10
- Adds extra firepower to help secure victory

### Defense Support

Reinforce a battalion member's defense against incoming attacks:

- You must own bases within **4 districts** of the defended base
- Support units remain **hidden** from attackers until wave 10
- Surprise enemies with unexpected reinforcements

## Strategic Benefits

- **Surprise factor** - Support units arrive mid-battle, disrupting enemy plans
- **Combined strength** - Overwhelm defenses through coordinated attacks
- **Territorial control** - Strengthen allies in contested areas
- **Hidden reinforcements** - Defense support remains invisible until wave 10
