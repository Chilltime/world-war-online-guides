# Destroy Rules

This guide covers the specific rules and restrictions for destruction attacks in World War Online.

## Basic Requirements

To launch a destruction attack, you must meet these conditions:

| Requirement | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Include Special Forces** | At least one Special Forces unit |
| **Valid target** | Target must be destroyable (not HQ or Capital) |
| **All common rules** | Same requirements as normal attacks |

## Destruction Restrictions

### What Cannot Be Destroyed

| Base Type | Can Destroy? | Reason |
|:----------|:------------:|:-------|
| Headquarters | **No** | Protected by game rules |
| Capital Bases | **No** | Essential for competitive play |
| Resource Bases | Yes | Valid target |
| Mine Bases | Yes | Valid target |
| Military Bases | Yes | Valid target |

### Standard Attack Restrictions

- Cannot attack your own bases
- Cannot attack battalion members' bases
- Attack limits apply (3 per player per district per 12 hours)
- Only one active attack per base at a time

## Victory Requirements

### For Successful Destruction

1. **Decisive Victory** - Must win decisively
2. **Special Forces survives** - At least one Special Forces unit alive at battle end
3. **Valid target** - Base must be destroyable type

### What Happens on Success

- Base is permanently removed from the game
- Special Forces unit is consumed
- Any resources stored in the base are lost
- The location cannot have a new base built there

### What Happens on Failure

- Base remains intact
- Your Special Forces survives (if not killed in battle)
- Can attempt again after cooldown

## Special Forces Consumption

**Special Forces are consumed after successful destruction:**

- Only consumed on successful destruction, not on failure
- If battle is lost, surviving Special Forces return to your army
- Plan destruction attacks carefully - each Special Forces can only destroy once

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Destroy

| Situation | Recommendation |
|:----------|:---------------|
| **Enemy forward base** | Destroy to remove staging point |
| **High-level resource base** | Consider conquering instead for value |
| **Strategic denial** | Destroy to prevent anyone from using location |
| **Weakening enemy battalion** | Target key infrastructure |

### Target Prioritization

| Priority | Target Type | Reason |
|:---------|:------------|:-------|
| High | Military Bases | Deny Special Forces production |
| High | Mine Bases | Cripple Iron economy |
| Medium | Resource Bases | Economic damage |
| Situational | Any forward position | Territorial control |

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Before destroying:

1. **Is conquest better?** - High-level bases have more value if conquered
2. **Is it worth a Special Forces?** - Special Forces cost WWO-Influence
3. **Strategic impact?** - Will this meaningfully affect the enemy?

## Defending Against Destruction

If enemies target your bases for destruction:

- **Use defense strategies** - Configure Destroy-focused static defense
- **Position anti-infantry** - Special Forces are infantry-class units
- **Layer defenses** - Combine static and dynamic strategies
