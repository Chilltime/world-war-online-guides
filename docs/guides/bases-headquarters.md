# Headquarters Base

![Your Headquarters Base](../assets/images/beginner_headquarters.webp "Your Headquarters Base")

Upon creating an account in World War Online, you will receive a **Headquarters Base** placed randomly in the territory of your Country, which cannot be relocated.

The Headquarters Base is your primary base that provides steady Iron production and serves as your main training facility where you can train [Supreme Units](units-supreme.md) and [Generals](units-tactic.md). Upgrading your Headquarters increases your Iron production and provides additional strategic advantages. Although your Headquarters can be raided for resources, it cannot be conquered or destroyed.

## Headquarters Defense Bonus

Districts containing your Headquarters provide enhanced defensive capabilities:

- **8 unit groups** can be positioned for defense (instead of the standard 6)
- **4,000 normal units** can be deployed (instead of the standard 3,000)
- This strategic advantage helps protect your command center and surrounding territory
- The headquarters defense bonus is indicated with a special badge in the district view
