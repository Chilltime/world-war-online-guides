# Conquer Rules

This guide covers the specific rules and restrictions for conquest attacks in World War Online.

## Basic Requirements

To launch a conquest attack, you must meet these conditions:

| Requirement | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Include a General** | General or General Boxer in your attack |
| **Valid target** | Target must be conquerable (not HQ) |
| **Below base limit** | Cannot exceed your maximum for that base type |
| **All common rules** | Same requirements as normal attacks |

## Conquest Restrictions

### Base Limits

You cannot conquer if you've reached your limit:

| Base Type | Maximum | Can Conquer? |
|:----------|:-------:|:------------:|
| Headquarters | 1 | No - cannot conquer HQ |
| Resource Bases | 10 | Yes, if under limit |
| Mine Bases | 4 | Yes, if under limit |
| Military Bases | 5 | Yes, if under limit |
| Capital Bases | N/A | Yes, no player limit |

### Target Restrictions

- **Cannot conquer Headquarters** - Only raid for resources
- Must own fewer than the maximum bases of that type
- Standard attack restrictions apply (no self-attack, no squad member attack)

## Capital Conquest Rules

Conquering Capital Bases has additional requirements:

| Requirement | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Squad membership** | Must be in a squad |
| **Active Capital Warfare** | Your squad must have an active session |
| **Valid target** | Capital must be in your assigned targets |
| **Pre-warfare join** | Must have joined squad before warfare started |

### No Attack Limit on Capitals

Unlike regular bases, Capital Bases have **no 24-hour attack limit** - you can attack the same capital multiple times during warfare.

## Victory Requirements

### For Successful Conquest

1. **Decisive Victory** - You must win decisively, not just survive
2. **General survives** - Your General must be alive at the end
3. **All conditions met** - Base limits and target restrictions satisfied

### What Counts as Decisive Victory

- Your forces eliminate all enemy defenders
- General survives through Wave 11
- Clear victory margin (not a tie breaker)

## General Consumption

**Generals are consumed after successful conquest:**

- Win or lose, Generals that conquer bases are removed from your army
- Plan conquests strategically - each General can only conquer once
- Train new Generals at your [Headquarters](bases-headquarters.md)

## Strategic Tips

### Before Conquering

1. **Check base limits** - Verify you can accept another base of that type
2. **Assess the target** - Is this base worth a General?
3. **Support your General** - Send strong forces to protect the General through 11 waves

### Target Prioritization

| Priority | Target Type | Reason |
|:---------|:------------|:-------|
| High | Level 10 bases | Maximum production value |
| High | Capital Bases | Competitive points |
| Medium | Strategic positions | Territorial advantage |
| Lower | Low-level bases | Less value than building new |
