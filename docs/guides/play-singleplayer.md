![Campaign Mode](../assets/images/header_campaign.webp "Campaign Mode")

World War Online offers single player content for players who want to test their skills, earn rewards, and progress without competitive pressure.

## Campaign Mode

The Campaign is a single player mode where you battle against NPC (Non-Playable Character) units.

### Campaign Structure

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Total Levels** | 50 progressively harder levels |
| **Victory Condition** | Kill all enemy units before Wave 50 |
| **Rewards** | WWO-Influence, Iron, Experience, Supreme Units |

### Campaign Benefits

Completing the Campaign provides substantial rewards:

- **1,196,856 Iron** total across all levels
- **452,500 Experience** for ranking up
- **Supreme Units** every 5 levels
- **WWO-Influence** for premium purchases

### Campaign Strategy

Each level has weak points that can be exploited:

- Study enemy unit compositions
- Counter with appropriate unit types
- Learn battle mechanics in a low-risk environment

### Campaign Mechanics

Campaign battles work like multiplayer with key differences:

- **No district requirement** - Fight from anywhere
- **Consistent difficulty** - Enemy composition is fixed per level
- **Repeatable** - Practice levels to improve strategy

## Battle Arena

Battle Arena is an advanced single player mode separate from the Campaign.

### How Battle Arena Works

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **ELO System** | Win to gain ELO, lose to drop |
| **Progressive Difficulty** | Higher ELO means harder challenges |
| **Better Rewards** | More ELO unlocks better rewards |
| **Dedicated Leaderboard** | Compete for top Arena positions |

### Arena Progression

As your ELO increases:

- **Better units** become available for use
- **Larger armies** can be fielded
- **Greater challenges** provide better rewards
- **Higher rankings** on the Arena Leaderboard

### 3D Real-Time Combat

Battle Arena introduces a new combat experience:

- **3D graphics** instead of 2D turn-based
- **Real-time action** for dynamic battles
- **Unique gameplay** different from standard combat

## Single Player vs Competitive

| Aspect | Single Player | Competitive |
|:-------|:--------------|:------------|
| **Requires Battalion** | No | Yes |
| **Time Pressure** | None | Season-based |
| **Rewards** | Fixed per level/ELO | Position-based |
| **Skill Development** | Practice-focused | Competition-focused |
