# Money

Money is a resource primarily used for training [Air units](units-normal.md). It's generated from dedicated Money Resource Bases.

## Uses for Money

Money is used for:

- Training all Air category units:
  - **UH-60 Black Hawk** - Versatile attack helicopter
  - **MQ-9 Reaper** - Unmanned combat aerial vehicle
  - **Chengdu J7** - Fighter aircraft
  - **Lynx** - Multi-role helicopter
- Supporting base construction and maintenance
- Trading with other players

## Production

Money is produced by **Money Resource Bases**. Build these bases to increase your Money production rate.

| Base Level | Production Rate |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
| Level 1 | 640/hour |
| Level 5 | 800/hour |
| Level 10 | 1,000/hour |

As your Money Resource Bases level up, they produce more Money per hour.

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Prioritize Money Production

- **Air-focused strategy** - If you rely heavily on Air units for combat
- **Supreme Air units** - Though Supreme units cost WWO-Influence, having a strong normal Air force complements them
- **Balanced armies** - Air units provide unique tactical advantages in combined-arms approaches

### Building Money Bases

- You can build up to **10 Resource Bases** total (shared across all resource types)
- Construction costs range from 4-8 WWO-Influence depending on how many resource bases you own
- Consider your overall resource needs when deciding how many Money bases to build
