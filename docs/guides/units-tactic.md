# Tactical Units

Tactical Units are specialized units in World War Online designed for strategic base operations rather than direct combat. Unlike Normal and Supreme units that focus on dealing damage, Tactical Units serve specific objectives: **conquering** or **destroying** enemy bases.

**Key Features:**
- Do **not** count toward your [unit capacity limit](unit-train.md#unit-capacity-system)
- Require [WWO-Influence](resources.md) to train
- Must be used strategically to achieve specific objectives
- Subject to specific [battle rules](battle-rules.md)

## General

The General is a Tactical Unit used to conquer enemy Bases. Generals provide unique tactical flexibility in combat.

-   **Unlocked at Military Rank**: 20
-   **Must belong to a Squad**
-   **Enters Battle on Wave**: 11
-   **Resource cost**: 5 WWO-Influence

### Special Features

-   **Extra Unit Slot**: Generals do not count toward your 6-unit group limit, allowing you to bring a General alongside your full complement of troops
-   **Star Indicator**: When a General is present in your attack formation, a star icon appears in the interface

This extra unit flexibility gives you more tactical options when leading your forces into battle, making Generals valuable for both conquest operations and general combat scenarios.

### Conquering Bases with the General

The General will automatically appear when you choose to conquer a Capital Base. When you conquer a Capital Base from an enemy, you take full control of it. In order to successfully conquer a Base, you must meet a few requirements:

-   The Battle must be a Decisive Victory
-   The General must survive the Battle

**Defensive Tips - Killing a General:**

When defending against conquest attacks, preventing the General from surviving is critical:

- **Set up ambush positions** near where the General spawns on Wave 11
- **Position anti-infantry units** strategically to target the General
- **Use concentrated fire** from multiple unit types to overwhelm the General quickly
- **Deploy Supreme Units** for higher damage output against Generals

Units can use multiple Strategies in Battle. Setting units in Ambush near to where the General will spawn on the 11th wave can give you an advantage in killing the enemy General when being attacked.

## Special Forces

The Special Forces is a Tactical Unit that allows you to destroy enemy bases if your attack is successful.

-   **Unlocked at Military Rank**: 25
-   **Strong against**: Infantry, Armored
-   **Weak against**: Air, Sea
-   **Resource cost**: 2 WWO-Influence

### Special Features

Special Forces units are elite tactical units with high defense capabilities across all categories. They excel at taking out infantry units, but are also effective against armored units. They have excellent dodge capabilities, making them difficult to hit in battle.

### Destroying Bases with Special Forces

To destroy an enemy base, you must use Special Forces units in your attack. When attacking with Special Forces:

-   The Battle must be a Decisive Victory
-   At least one Special Forces unit must survive the battle
-   Base destruction is permanent and cannot be undone
-   **Cannot destroy [Capital bases](capital-warfare.md)**

**Strategic Uses:**
- Deny resources to enemy players by eliminating their resource bases
- Remove military bases to reduce enemy unit capacity (each base provides 10,000 unit capacity)
- Create territorial advantage by destroying strategic positions
- Counter expansion by targeting newly built bases

**Defensive Tips - Countering Special Forces:**

Special Forces units are strong against Infantry and Armored units but weak against Air and Sea units:

- **Deploy Airforce units** (especially anti-infantry like Black Hawk) to counter Special Forces
- **Use Navy units** if the base is coastal
- **Avoid relying solely on Infantry/Armored defenses** against Special Forces attacks
