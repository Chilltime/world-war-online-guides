## General

The General is a Tactical Unit. It is used to conquer enemy Bases.

-   Unlocked at Military Rank: 25;
-   Must belong to a Squad.
-   Enters Battle on Wave: 11.

## Special Forces

The Special Forces is a Tactical Unit that allows you to destroy enemy bases if your attack is successful.

-   Unlocked at Military Rank: 40;
-   Strong against: Infantry, Armored
-   Weak against: Air, Sea
-   Resource cost: 2 WWO-Influence

Special Forces units are elite tactical units with high defense capabilities across all categories. They excel at taking out infantry units, but are also effective against armored units. They have excellent dodge capabilities, making them difficult to hit in battle.

## Conquering a Base

The General will automatically appear when you choose to conquer a Capital Base. When you conquer a
Capital Base from an enemy, you take full control of it. In order to successfully conquer a Base,
you must meet a few requirements:

-   The Battle must be a Decisive Victory;
-   The General must survive the Battle.

## Destroying a Base

To destroy an enemy base, you must use Special Forces units in your attack. When attacking with Special Forces:

-   The Battle must be a Decisive Victory
-   At least one Special Forces unit must survive the battle
-   Base destruction is permanent and cannot be undone

Destroying a base can be strategically important when denying resources or territory to enemy players.

## Tips for Killing a General

Units can use multiple Strategies in Battle. Setting units in Ambush near to where the General will
spawn on the 11th wave can give you an advantage in killing the enemy General when being attacked.
