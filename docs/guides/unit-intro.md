# Introduction to Units

Units are used to fight in World War Online.

There are 4 different types of Units within World War Online:

-   Infantry Units;
-   Armored Units;
-   Airforce Units;
-   Navy Units.

Commanders unlock Units as their [Military Rank](player-rank.md) increases. You can find a complete list of all units and their required military ranks [here](player-rank.md#unit-military-rank-requirements). There are also three different classes of Units:

-   [Normal Units](units-normal.md) cost different types of [resources](resources.md) - Money, Food, or Iron - depending on the unit type. They constitute the bulk of your army.
-   [Supreme Units](units-supreme.md) cost WWO-Influence. They are much stronger than Normal Units but fight in lower numbers.
-   [Tactical Units](units-tactic.md) are units with special roles, like the General for conquering bases and the Special Forces for destroying enemy bases.

## Unit Capacity Limits

Your army size is limited by the number of [bases](bases.md) you own. Each non-capital base provides capacity for **10,000 Normal Units**:

- **Normal Units** (Infantry, Armored, Airforce, Navy) count toward your unit cap
- **Supreme Units** do NOT count toward your unit cap
- **Tactical Units** (Generals, Special Forces) do NOT count toward your unit cap

Building more bases increases your unit capacity, allowing you to field larger armies. Learn more about bases and unit capacity in the [Bases guide](bases.md) and [Training Units guide](unit-train.md).
