# Resource Bases

Resource Bases produce each type of [resource](resources.md) in the game: Money, Iron, Food, and Brick. You can build up to **10 Resource bases per player**, allowing you to specialize in the resources that support your strategic goals.

## Resource Types

Resource Bases come in four varieties, each producing a different resource:

| Base Type | Resource Produced | Primary Use |
|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------|
| **Money Base** | Money | Training [Air units](units-normal.md) |
| **Iron Base** | Iron | Training [Armored](units-normal.md) and [Sea units](units-normal.md) |
| **Food Base** | Food | Training [Infantry units](units-normal.md) |
| **Brick Base** | Brick | Constructing and upgrading all [bases](bases.md) |

## Base Construction Costs

Building Resource Bases requires [WWO-Influence](resources.md), with costs increasing based on how many resource bases you already own:

| Number of Resource Bases | Construction Cost (WWO) |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 1                        | 4                       |
| 2                        | 4                       |

| 9                        | 8                       |
| 10                       | 8                       |

## Strategic Considerations

### Early Game Strategy

In the early game, prioritize **Brick Resource Bases** to rapidly build new bases and upgrade existing ones. This establishes your economic foundation and allows faster expansion.

### Mid to Late Game Strategy

As you progress, shift focus to resource bases that support your preferred unit composition:

- **Food Bases** - If you rely on Infantry armies
- **Iron Bases** - If you prefer Armored or Sea units
- **Money Bases** - If you focus on Air power

### Key Features

- **Can be conquered** - Enemy players with Generals can take your resource bases
- **Can be destroyed** - Enemy players with Special Forces can permanently destroy them
- **Can be raided** - Resources can be stolen in successful attacks
- **Level preserved on conquest** - When conquered, the base retains its level
