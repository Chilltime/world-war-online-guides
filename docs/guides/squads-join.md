3. Click **"Request to Join"** on squads that interest you
4. Wait for the Leader to accept your request

## What to Look for in a Squad

### Activity Level

- **Active squads** participate regularly in Capital Warfare
- Check when they last competed
- Look for squads with consistent member activity

### League Position

| League | What it Means |
|:-------|:--------------|
| **Gold (1-10)** | Elite squads, high expectations |
| **Silver (11-20)** | Competitive, established teams |
| **Bronze (21-30)** | Growing squads, good for newer players |
| **Iron (31+)** | Building phase, learning together |

### Squad Size

- Full squads (8 members) may have limited spots
- Smaller squads might need more individual contribution
- Consider the balance of members from your country vs foreign

## After Joining

### Immediate Steps

1. **Introduce yourself** in Squad Chat
2. **Learn the squad's strategy** and expectations
3. **Position units** near squad operations
4. **Authorize army sharing** in Settings (if comfortable)

### Capital Warfare Timing

**Important:** If you join after Capital Warfare matchmaking:

- You **cannot participate** in the current warfare
- You **can participate** in the next warfare
- Move your armies away from active capitals (you can be attacked but cannot attack)

## Squad Roles

When you join, you start as a **Member**:

| Role | Rights |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Member** | Participate in warfare, use squad chat |
| **Captain** | Accept members, initiate warfare search |
| **Leader** | Full control including promoting/kicking |

Demonstrate your value to potentially earn promotion to Captain.

## Changing Squads

You can leave and join different squads, but:

- Leaving mid-warfare removes your warfare access
- Your rank resets to Member in the new squad
- Frequent changes may affect your reputation
