# Attacking (Raids)

Normal attacks, also called raids, focus on resource acquisition. This is the most common type of attack and requires no special units - just your regular army.

## How Raiding Works

When you win a battle through a normal attack, your surviving units can steal resources from the enemy base:

| Target Base | Resources Available |
|:------------|:-------------------|
| **Headquarters** | Various resources based on HQ level |
| **Resource Bases** | The specific resource that base produces (Food, Iron, Money, or Brick) |
| **Mine Bases** | Accumulated Iron |

## Resource Carrying Capacity

The amount of resources you can steal depends on your surviving units:

- **Each unit can carry 5% of its total health** in resources
- Heavier units can carry more resources per unit
- Supreme units have significantly higher carrying capacity

### Carrying Capacity Examples

| Unit | Health | Carrying Capacity |
|:-----|:------:|:-----------------:|
| Bazooka | 135 HP | 6.75 resources |
| Dongfeng | 225 HP | 11.25 resources |
| Abrams (Supreme) | 4,000 HP | 200 resources |

## Strategic Raiding

### Maximize Resource Theft

- **Use heavier units** when your goal is resource stealing
- **Send more units** to increase total carrying capacity
- **Target high-level bases** for larger resource pools

### Efficient Raiding

- **Scout first** to assess if the target is worth the effort
- **Balance force size** - don't over-commit to weak targets
- **Consider travel time** when planning raid routes

### Raiding vs Other Attack Types

| Factor | Raiding | Conquering | Destroying |
|:-------|:--------|:-----------|:-----------|
| **Special units needed** | No | General | Special Forces |
| **Repeatable** | Yes | Base limit applies | One-time |
| **Outcome** | Resources | Ownership | Removal |

## Attack Limitations

- **3 attacks per 12 hours** per player per district (non-capital bases)
- **One active attack** per specific base at a time
- Cannot attack your own bases or battalion members
