# Country Leaderboard

The Country Leaderboard showcases national pride by ranking countries based on how their squads perform in [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md). Unlike other leaderboards, the Country Leaderboard uses an **Olympic-style medal ranking system**.

## How It Works

When squads compete in Capital Warfare and earn points, those points contribute to their country's standing based on the squad's league:

1. **Squads earn points** through Capital Warfare performance
2. **Points flow to countries** based on each squad's league tier
3. **Countries accumulate medals** (Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron) from their squads
4. **Olympic-style ranking** determines country positions

## Medal Tiers

Your squad's league determines which medal type your country receives:

| Squad League | Medal Earned | Positions |
|:-------------|:-------------|:---------:|
| **Gold League** | Gold Medal | 1-10 |
| **Silver League** | Silver Medal | 11-20 |
| **Bronze League** | Bronze Medal | 21-30 |
| **Iron League** | Iron Medal | 31+ |

## Olympic-Style Ranking

Countries are ranked using the same system as the Olympic Games:

1. **Gold medals** are compared first - more golds always wins
2. **Silver medals** break ties when gold counts are equal
3. **Bronze medals** break ties when silver counts are equal
4. **Iron medals** serve as the final tiebreaker

### Example Rankings

| Position | Country | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Iron |
|:--------:|:--------|:----:|:------:|:------:|:----:|
| 1st | Portugal | 5 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| 2nd | Brazil | 4 | 8 | 10 | 5 |
| 3rd | Spain | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

In this example, Portugal ranks first because it has 5 gold medals, beating Brazil's 4 golds. Brazil ranks above Spain because, with equal golds (4), Brazil has more silvers (8 vs 3).

## Point Multipliers

The Country Leaderboard benefits from the same **point multiplier system** as other leaderboards. During the final weeks of each season, squad contributions to their country are amplified:

| Timing | Multiplier |
|:-------|:----------:|
| Final week | **4x** |
| Second-to-last week | **3x** |
| Third-to-last week | **2x** |
| All other weeks | 1x |

This makes end-of-season competition even more critical for national rankings.

## Contributing to Your Country

- **Join a competitive squad** - Your squad's success directly impacts your country
