# Leaderboards Overview

World War Online features competitive leaderboards that rank players and battalions based on their performance. Climbing the leaderboards earns prestige, rewards, and recognition.

## Types of Leaderboards

| Leaderboard | Tracks | Rewards |
|:------------|:-------|:--------|
| **[Battalion Leaderboard](leaderboard-battalion.md)** | Battalion performance in Capital Warfare | WWO-Influence for top battalions |
| **[Player Leaderboard](leaderboard-player.md)** | Individual battle victories | Personal ranking |
| **[Country Leaderboard](leaderboard-country.md)** | National performance across all battalions | National pride |

## Battalion Leaderboard

The Battalion Leaderboard ranks battalions based on points earned through [Capital Warfare](capital-warfare.md). Battalions compete across four leagues:

| League | Positions | End-of-Season Rewards |
|:-------|:---------:|:---------------------|
| **Gold** | 1-10 | WWO-Influence (varies by position) |
| **Silver** | 11-20 | WWO-Influence |
| **Bronze** | 21-30 | Recognition |
| **Iron** | 31+ | Participation |

### Top Battalion Rewards

| Position | WWO-Influence |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
| 1st | 50,000 |
| 2nd | 25,000 |
| 3rd | 10,000 |
| 4th-5th | 5,000 |
| 6th-10th (Gold) | 2,500 |
| 11th-20th (Silver) | 1,000 |

## Player Leaderboard

The Player Leaderboard tracks individual performance based on battle victories. Your position reflects your combat effectiveness and activity level.

## Country Leaderboard

The Country Leaderboard ranks nations using an **Olympic-style medal system**. Countries earn medals when their battalions perform well in Capital Warfare:

| Medal | Earned From |
|:------|:------------|
| **Gold** | Battalions in Gold League (positions 1-10) |
| **Silver** | Battalions in Silver League (positions 11-20) |
| **Bronze** | Battalions in Bronze League (positions 21-30) |
| **Iron** | Battalions in Iron League (positions 31+) |

Countries are ranked by gold medals first, then silver, bronze, and iron as tiebreakers. This creates a true Olympic ranking where a country with more golds always ranks higher.

## Point Multiplier System

The final weeks of each season feature increased point multipliers:

| Timing | Multiplier |
|:-------|:----------:|
| Final week | **4x** |
| Second-to-last week | **3x** |
| Third-to-last week | **2x** |
| All other weeks | 1x |

This system makes end-of-season gameplay significantly more competitive and rewarding.
