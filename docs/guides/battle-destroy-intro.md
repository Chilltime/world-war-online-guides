# Destroying Bases

Destroy attacks permanently remove enemy bases from the game using **Special Forces** tactical units. This is the most aggressive action you can take against enemy infrastructure.

## How Destruction Works

To destroy a base:

1. **Include Special Forces** in your attack force
2. **Achieve a Decisive Victory** in the battle
3. **At least one Special Forces survives** the combat
4. The base is permanently destroyed

**Important:** Special Forces are consumed after successfully destroying a base.

## What You Can Destroy

| Base Type | Can Destroy? | Notes |
|:----------|:------------:|:------|
| Resource Bases | Yes | All resource types (Food, Iron, Money, Brick) |
| Mine Bases | Yes | High-value Iron targets |
| Military Bases | Yes | Deny Special Forces training |
| Capital Bases | **No** | Cannot destroy capitals |
| Headquarters | **No** | Cannot destroy HQ |

## Permanent Destruction

When a base is destroyed:

- **Completely removed** from the game
- **Cannot be rebuilt** by any player in that location
- **Resources lost** - any stored resources are gone
- **Territory denied** - the position is no longer usable

## Strategic Uses

### Resource Denial

- Destroy enemy resource bases to cripple their economy
- Target bases producing resources they depend on most
- Force enemies to rebuild from scratch

### Territorial Control

- Remove enemy forward positions
- Deny strategic locations near your territory
- Counter expansion by eliminating newly built bases

### Competitive Advantage

- Weaken enemy squads by destroying their infrastructure
- Reduce their ability to train and deploy units
- Create resource shortages that affect their warfare capability
