# Friend Invites

Earn free WWO-Influence daily by inviting friends to World War Online. The more active and engaged your invited friends become, the more you earn.

## How Friend Invites Work

The Friend Invite system rewards you for bringing new or returning players to the game:

1. **Generate your unique invite link** from the Store's Friends section
2. **Share your link** with friends via Facebook, Discord, or direct messaging
3. **Your friend creates an account** using your invite link
4. **You earn daily WWO** based on your friend's activity and progression

## Daily Rewards by Tier

Your invited friends are automatically assigned to tiers based on their activity and progression. Higher tiers earn you more daily WWO:

| Tier | Requirements | Daily WWO Earned |
|:-----|:-------------|:----------------:|
| **Tier 1** | Active in last 24 hours | 1 WWO |
| **Tier 2** | Tier 1 + Rank 20 or higher | 2 WWO |
| **Tier 3** | Tier 2 + In a Squad | 3 WWO |
| **Tier 4** | Tier 2 + Rank 30 or higher | 4 WWO |
| **Tier 5** | Tier 2 + Rank 40 or higher | 5 WWO |

### How Tiers Work

- Tiers are cumulative - your friend must meet all lower tier requirements
- Tier updates automatically based on your friend's current status
- If a friend becomes inactive for 24+ hours, they drop to Tier 0 (no daily WWO until they return)
- When they return and play again, they automatically restore to their appropriate tier

**Example**: A Rank 35 player in a squad who was active today qualifies for Tier 4 (4 WWO/day) because they meet: active (Tier 1) + Rank 20+ (Tier 2) + Rank 30+ (Tier 4). Being in a squad doesn't increase their tier further since Tier 4 is higher than Tier 3.

## Managing Your Friend Slots

You can have up to **5 active friends** earning you WWO simultaneously:

### Friend States

- **Active**: Currently earning you daily WWO (maximum 5 slots)
- **New**: Recently joined friends waiting to be activated
- **Archived**: Previously active friends you've archived to make room for others

### Activating Friends

When you have 5 active friends and want to add a new one:

1. Archive one of your current active friends to open a slot
2. Activate the new friend from your "New" list
3. The newly activated friend starts earning you daily WWO

You can reactivate archived friends anytime by archiving a current active friend first.

## Collecting Your Rewards

### Collection Rules

- **Cooldown**: You can collect once per 24-hour UTC cycle per friend
- **Balance Requirement**: You can only collect when your WWO balance is under 100 WWO (Store-wide free WWO rule)
- **Manual Collection**: Rewards don't auto-collect - visit the Store's Friends section daily

### How to Collect

1. Navigate to **Store > Friends**
2. Find friends with available rewards (indicated by a collect button)
3. Click **Collect** to receive their tier's daily WWO
4. Rewards are added immediately to your WWO-Influence balance

### WWO Balance Requirement

The Store enforces a global rule for all free WWO sources (Supply Crates, Friend Invites, etc.):

**You can only collect free WWO rewards when your current WWO balance is below 100 WWO.**

This prevents players from hoarding large amounts of free premium currency. The system checks your balance before allowing collection:

- **Balance < 100 WWO**: ✓ You can collect friend rewards
- **Balance ≥ 100 WWO**: ✗ Collection blocked until you spend some WWO

**Example**: If you have 95 WWO and try to collect 5 WWO from a Tier 5 friend, the collection succeeds. If you already have 100 WWO or more, you must spend some before collecting again.

This rule applies to the inviter only - your friends can have any amount of WWO without affecting your ability to earn from them.

## Eligibility Requirements

### For You (The Inviter)

- Must have a World War Online account
- Access to the Store's Friends section

### For Your Friends (The Invitees)

To create a valid invite relationship, your friend must:

- **Be a new player** OR **inactive for 30+ days** before using your invite link
- **Match your country** - they must be from the same country as you
- **Valid IP location** - their IP must match their profile country
- **Unique household** - cannot share the same IP address with you

These requirements prevent system abuse and ensure fair use of the invite program.

## Anti-Abuse Protection

The Friend Invite system includes several safeguards:

### Validation Checks

Every invite is validated for:

- **30-day inactivity**: Prevents inviting existing active players
- **Country matching**: Inviter and invitee must be from the same country
- **IP verification**: Profile country must match actual connection location
- **Shared IP detection**: Prevents self-inviting or household farming
- **Balance requirement**: Inviter must have less than 100 WWO to collect (Store rule)
- **Cooldown enforcement**: 24-hour collection intervals per friend

### What Happens If Validation Fails

If your friend doesn't meet eligibility requirements:

- The invite relationship won't be created when they sign up
- You won't be able to collect rewards from that friend
- Both you and your friend can still play normally

This is not a penalty - it simply means the invite didn't qualify under the program rules.

## Sharing Your Invite Link

### Getting Your Link

1. Open the **Store**
2. Navigate to the **Friends** section
3. Copy your unique invite link

Your link format: `worldwaronline.com/i/YourCodename?utm_source=origin`

### Best Practices for Sharing

- **Facebook**: Use the quick-share button for one-click posting
- **Discord**: Use the quick-share button to post in your server
- **Direct messaging**: Copy and send your link to specific friends
- **Social media**: Share on Twitter, Instagram, or other platforms

### Tracking Your Invites

Your invite link includes tracking parameters so you can see where your successful invites come from:

- `utm_source=facebook` - Shared via Facebook button
- `utm_source=discord` - Shared via Discord button
- `utm_source=direct` - Manually copied link

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I invite someone from a different country?

No. Both you and your invited friend must be from the same country for the invite to be valid. This is an anti-abuse measure.

### What if my friend stops playing?

If your friend becomes inactive for 24+ hours, they drop to Tier 0 and stop generating daily rewards. When they return and become active again, they automatically restore to their appropriate tier based on their rank and squad status.

### Can I remove a friend and add them back later?

Yes. You can archive active friends and reactivate them later. There's no lifetime limit on how much you can earn from a single friend, but you can only collect when your WWO balance is below 100.

### What counts as "active in last 24 hours"?

A player is considered active if they've logged into World War Online within the past 24 hours.

### Can I have more than 5 friends total?

Yes, but only 5 can be active (earning you WWO) at once. Additional friends will be in your "New" list until you activate them.

### Do I need to be online when my friend signs up?

No. The invite relationship is created automatically when your friend signs up using your link, regardless of whether you're online.

### What happens if I have 100 or more WWO?

You won't be able to collect friend rewards until you spend some WWO to bring your balance below 100. This is a Store-wide rule that applies to all free WWO sources (Supply Crates, Friend Invites, etc.) to prevent hoarding premium currency. Your friends will continue to qualify for their tiers - you just can't collect until your balance drops below 100.
