# Brick

Brick is a construction material resource used for creating and upgrading bases. It's produced by dedicated Brick Resource Bases.

## Uses for Brick

Brick is used for:

- Creating new [bases](bases.md)
- Upgrading all base types:
  - [Headquarters](bases-headquarters.md)
  - [Resource Bases](bases-resource.md)
  - [Military Bases](bases.md#military-bases)
  - [Mine Bases](bases-mines.md)

## Production

Brick is produced by **Brick Resource Bases**. Build these bases to ensure a steady supply of construction materials.

| Base Level | Production Rate |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
| Level 1 | 640/hour |
| Level 5 | 800/hour |
| Level 10 | 1,000/hour |

As with other resource bases, the production rate increases as you upgrade the base level.

## Strategic Considerations

### Early Game Priority

In the early game, **Brick is your most important resource**. Prioritize Brick production to:

- Rapidly build new bases
- Upgrade existing bases faster
- Establish your economic foundation

### Upgrade Costs

All base types share the same Brick upgrade costs:

| Base Level | Upgrade Cost (Brick) |
|:----------:|:--------------------:|
| Level 2 | 1,000 |
| Level 3 | 2,000 |
| Level 4 | 4,000 |
| Level 5 | 8,000 |
| Level 6 | 16,000 |
| Level 7 | 32,000 |
| Level 8 | 50,000 |
| Level 9 | 75,000 |
| Level 10 | 100,000 |

### Building Brick Bases

- You can build up to **10 Resource Bases** total (shared across all resource types)
- Construction costs range from 4-8 WWO-Influence depending on how many resource bases you own
- Consider building multiple Brick bases early, then transitioning to other resources as your infrastructure matures

### Efficient Brick Usage

- **Focus upgrades** - Upgrade bases strategically rather than spreading upgrades thin
- **Plan construction** - Know what bases you want to build before spending Brick
- **Protect Brick bases** - Brick production is valuable early game - defend it
