# Mine Bases

Mine Bases produce significantly more Iron than Resource bases but are limited to **4 per player**. They have the highest Iron production rate among all base types, making them valuable for players who rely heavily on Armored and Sea units.

## Why Build Mine Bases?

Mine Bases are specialized for high-volume Iron production:

| Comparison | Mine Base (Lv 10) | Iron Resource Base (Lv 10) |
|:-----------|:-----------------:|:--------------------------:|
| **Production** | 2,000 Iron/hour | 1,000 Iron/hour |
| **Maximum Bases** | 4 | 10 (shared with other resource types) |

Mine Bases produce **double** the Iron of regular Iron Resource Bases at the same level, making them essential for players focused on Armored or Sea unit strategies.

## Base Construction Costs

Building Mine Bases requires [WWO-Influence](resources.md), with costs increasing for each additional mine:

| Number of Mine Bases | Construction Cost (WWO) |
|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 1                    | 8                       |
| 2                    | 10                      |
| 3                    | 12                      |
| 4                    | 14                      |

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Build Mine Bases

- **Armored-focused strategy** - If you rely on BMD-3 Bakhcha, M3A3 Bradley, Gepard, or Dongfeng units
- **Navy-focused strategy** - If you use Christy, Pomornik, Arleigh Burke, or Akula II units
- **Headquarters upgrades** - Iron is required for HQ upgrades, so Mine Bases accelerate your progression

### Key Features

- **Limited quantity** - Maximum of 4 Mine Bases per player
- **Higher construction cost** - More expensive than Resource Bases (8-14 WWO vs 4-8 WWO)
- **Can be conquered** - Enemy Generals can take your Mine Bases
- **Can be destroyed** - Enemy Special Forces can permanently destroy them
- **Can be raided** - Resources can be stolen in successful attacks
