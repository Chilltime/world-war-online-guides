# Battle Statistics

Battle Statistics track your combat performance in World War Online, providing insights into your victories, defeats, and overall effectiveness as a commander.

## Statistics Tracked

Your battle statistics include:

| Statistic | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Total Battles** | Number of battles you've participated in |
| **Victories** | Battles won (Decisive Victory) |
| **Defeats** | Battles lost |
| **Win Rate** | Percentage of battles won |
| **Bases Conquered** | Total bases taken with Generals |
| **Bases Destroyed** | Total bases destroyed with Special Forces |

```
