# Game Rules

Here you can find some ground rules for World War Online!

## 1. Registration and Ownership

Each player may only own one account in the game. The login service used to register in the game
must be under personal and exclusive control of the person who registered.

The owner of the account is fully responsible for all actions done with the account.

The account is non-transferable and exclusively associated to only one login service. Each player
holds reponsibility to maintaining their login service.

### 1.1. Avatar Image and Codename

When you choose to upload a new avatar image instead of using the available avatars, you need to
take the following rules into consideration:

-   Don't use your avatar and/or codename to offend or insult any other player or country;
-   Don't use your avatar and/or codename to protest against other players, countries or the game;
-   Don't use your avatar and/or codename to report bugs or situations in the game, use the
    [Support Form](https://www.worldwaronline.com/support/create);
-   Don't use your avatar and/or codename to provide contact information.
-   No inappropriate profiles (usernames and avatars): avoid special characters, emoji, obscenities,
    impersonation and/or any controversial or offensive content, which includes (but it is not
    limited to) racism, religion, politics, real-world violence, terrorism, content of a sexual
    nature, and hate speech.

By uploading a file you certify that you have the right to distribute this picture and that it does
not violate the [Terms of Service](tos.md)

## 2. Bots, scripts and access

The game must be played on an unmodified internet browser. It is forbidden to use any bots, scripts,
page reloaders or macros to automate actions. It is also forbidden to use foreign proxies and VPN
connections to access the game in other countries or use other forms of concealing your identity.

It's also forbidden to share any IP connection with more than 1 player, on certain exceptions,
including but not limited to:

-   Being in a public location (schools, universities, cafes);
-   Sharing the same house.

Proof of these excepetions may be required and, if not provided, can lead to suspension and
permanent ban from the game.

## 3. Bugs and Errors

Bugs and errors may not be exploited by players. If a bug is found, the player must report it
immediately using our [Support Form](https://www.worldwaronline.com/support/create).

## 4. Fake Accounts

Creating fake accounts for the sake of spying any other country is strictly forbidden. Providing
military or strategic information to foreign countries is also forbidden, this includes giving
attack plans, base location, military strenghts, which players are online, etc.

## 5. Purchasing WWO-Influence

All purchases of WWO-Influence must be valid and fraud free. It is strictly forbidden to directly or
indirectly interfere with or circumvent any security features related to the purchase, transfer or
trade of WWO-Influence. WWO-Influence is not transferable between accounts belonging to different
players. If you purchase WWO-Influence you agree to our [Store Rules](store-rules.md).

You are also forbidden to share a purchasing account with other players, as it violates our Store
Rules.

## 6. Punishment

Breaking any of these rules can result in a reset or ban of any accounts involved. Punishments will
always exceed the gain of violating the rules. Resources, bases and units lost during suspension
will not be returned.

No player has the right to claim payment for WWO-Influence lost due to suspension. There is no
special treatment for WWO-Influence users regarding game rules neither in the time we take to deal
with the case nor the actions taken. Players that have been suspended can contact World War Online
support using our [Support Form](https://www.worldwaronline.com/support/create).

Bans or account reset may not be discussed in public (Chat, social media and forums). Appeals must
be in English and must not be offensive or contain threats of any sort. We only consider e-mails
that correctly identify the account name and information.

-   All Topics, comments and replies must, first and foremost, abide by the Game Rules as well as
    World War Online's [Terms of Service](tos.md).
-   English is the only permitted language in the global forums. You are free to speak in your
    native language in your Country Chat, Battalion Chat or through Private Messages sent to other
    players, if there is a mutual understanding.

## Player Code of Conduct
