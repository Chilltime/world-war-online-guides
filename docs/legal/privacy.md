# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 24, 2018 | **Last Updated:** January 10, 2025

Welcome to World War Online, a game operated by Chilltime Lda. ("Chilltime"). This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Chilltime Lda and our affiliates ("Chilltime", "we" or "us"). We use the terms "member", "you" and "your" to mean any person using our Platform or any applications created by Chilltime and available through networking sites ("SNS App"), any software running on Chilltime's servers, ("Chilltime Software"), content, related documentation, information on the Chilltime domain, and information made available by users to each other through the Chilltime Software (collectively the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.

Collection of Information We collect information about you when: You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account). We record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies). We receive some of it from third parties (social media companies). We also collect information, such as usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and similar technologies. The particular kinds of information we gather are dependent on how you interact with us, like which Chilltime services you use and how you do so.

## 1.1. Information you provide to us

We collect information you choose to provide or give to us in any manner. For example, we collect information that you provide when you create an account or communicate with us. The types of information that we may collect include your name, username, password, email address, payment method data, photos. We collect information you enter or otherwise provide on World War Online, including: Email address; Your username, password, and other details that help us secure and provide access to World War Online (like when you login to our game or websites); Your name, payment method, and other details we collect to help process purchases you make (like when you buy credits at our Store); World War Online also offers social features like forums and chat. When you use these features, the information you share is public information – this means we may collect and use the information you provide, and in some cases it may also be collected or used by others without your knowledge. In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in other content ("Content"), such as in products. Any action you perform with other users are considered public, and at your own discretion. When you use a product with social network features like ours, note that some information will be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We may record gameplay and related information (such as Username, Military Rank, and in-game actions), and replay or otherwise make it available to other users without further notice to you.

## 1.2. Information we collect automatically

**Log Information:** your use of World War Online (such as timestamps, clicks, scrolling, browsing times, searches, referral/exit pages, and in-game activity and interactions); **Device Information:** your computer or device (such as IP addresses, unique device IDs, processing capabilities, manufacturer and model, language and other regional settings, geographic location, and screen resolution and similar settings); **Information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies:** your connection to World War Online, including details about the network and software you are using (such as browser type and version, operating system name and version, ISP, and your preference settings); **Information on performance:** How World War Online performs, including problems you may encounter (such as loading errors and response times).

## 1.3. Information We Collect From Third Parties

**Social Media Services:** We obtain information from third parties if you use their services in connection with World War Online (such linking your Facebook account with the game). Your privacy settings on the third party's service control what information they share with us. Please make sure you're comfortable with what they might share by reviewing their posted policies, and if applicable, modifying your privacy settings directly on their service. **Information From other Third Party sources:** We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Chilltime products and other users of Chilltime, to supplement your profile.

## 2. How We Collect Information

### 2.1. Cookies & Related Technologies

World War Online may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by World War Online. You should also be aware that most content delivered through Chilltime products originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place "cookies" on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself. We also use our servers in connection with these technologies to collect information about the ways you interact with World War Online and store it in log files. This may include, for example, information that your device, browser, or operating system sends to us when you access World War Online (like device IDs, IP addresses, and hardware or software specifications) and details about how you use your World War Online account (like the particular features you use, your in-game interactions and statistics, and other similar info). We use information gathered through technologies like cookies for several reasons, including: To monitor, secure, and maintain World War Online (like preventing fraud); To enhance your browsing experience (such as allowing you to log-in to your account); To analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns); To control the display of ads (including providing you with targeted offers); To support and gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns (like letting us know if you've clicked on our ads or opened our emails); To better personalize your visit and store your preferences and settings (for example, displaying content in your local language); To otherwise manage our relationship with users and provide World War Online under the Terms of Use (including help prevent toxicity and ensure a fair gaming environment). Please note that disabling technologies like cookies may prevent you from using the full functionality of World War Online and the game may not work as we intended.

### 2.2. Analytics & Third Party Advertising Companies

In order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the World War Online site or playing World War Online or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time ("Activity Information"). We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and on certain Chilltime products and SNS Apps. Our system and the third-party advertising technology uses information derived from Activity Information, Chilltime's cookies on your hard drive, your visits to our site, the Chilltime products that you view and the SNS Apps you use to target advertising within our site or Chilltime products or SNS Apps. In addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on our site and other sites. In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called "clear gifs" or "beacons") to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site. Chilltime does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Chilltime to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach. By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as long as Chilltime sees fit.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above. We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Chilltime or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Chilltime related to the business which collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company.

Chilltime, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view the Content that you transmit to the service to provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.

### 3.4. Public Chat or Forums

We've empowered our users to help police compliance with our policies related to certain in-game behavior. Our product users may report each other and submit descriptions of their in-game activity and actions to help us determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to user conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions). We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor, chat and similar details about in-game interactions for a period we determine in our sole discretion is appropriate to help us, among other things, detect and prevent toxicity, enforce our rules and policies, and foster a more positive gaming community for our users. We use both manual (like many user Support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning) tools and techniques to support these efforts. Please be kind to other users, observe our policies related to user behavior (including our Terms of Use), and always be careful what you share in chat!
